# 6/7 Coding Challenge Scripts

This directory contains the automation scripts that power the 6/7 Coding Challenge. These scripts help maintain consistency, track progress, and simplify the daily workflow.

## Script Overview

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cc-setup.sh` | One-time setup script for the challenge environment |
| `cc-start-day.sh` | Initializes the environment for a new challenge day |
| `cc-log-progress.sh` | Records the day's progress in the weekly log file |
| `cc-push-updates.sh` | Commits and pushes changes, increments the day counter |
| `cc-status.sh` | Displays the current challenge status and progress |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall-tech/6-7-coding-challenge.git
   cd 6-7-coding-challenge
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```zsh
   zsh scripts/cc-setup.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Create necessary directories in `~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge/`
   - Install scripts to `~/bin/`
   - Initialize the day counter
   - Add aliases to your `.zshrc`
   - Set up git repository with .gitignore

3. Source your `.zshrc` or restart your terminal:
   ```zsh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Prerequisites

The scripts require these tools to be installed:

- **zsh**: As your shell (`echo $SHELL`)
- **git**: For version control (`git --version`)
- **tmux**: For terminal session management (`tmux -V`)

Optional but recommended:
- **neovim**: For editing files (`nvim --version`)
- **Ruby**: For Phase 1 projects (`ruby -v`)

## Daily Workflow

1. Start your day:
   ```zsh
   ccstart
   ```
   This opens a tmux session with your challenge environment.

2. After your coding session, log your progress:
   ```zsh
   cclog
   ```

3. Push your changes and increment the day counter:
   ```zsh
   ccpush
   ```

4. Check your overall progress:
   ```zsh
   ccstatus
   ```

## Custom Modifications

You can modify these scripts to better suit your workflow. Here are common customization points:

### README Template

To customize the README template, edit `cc-start-day.sh`:

```zsh
# Find this section in cc-start-day.sh
cat > $PROJECT_DIR/README.md << EOF
# Day $CURRENT_DAY - Phase $PHASE (Week $WEEK_FORMATTED)

## Today's Focus
...
EOF
```

### tmux Layout

To change the tmux window layout, modify this section in `cc-start-day.sh`:

```zsh
# Configure the windows
tmux split-window -v -p 30 -t coding-challenge

# For horizontal split instead:
# tmux split-window -h -p 50 -t coding-challenge

# For additional panes:
# tmux split-window -v -p 30 -t coding-challenge:0.1
```

### Status Display

To adjust the status display, edit `cc-status.sh`:

```zsh
# Modify the status display format
printf "${BOLD}║${RESET} ${GREEN}Current Day:${RESET} %-37s ${BOLD}║${RESET}\n" "$CURRENT_DAY/500"

# Add additional metrics
printf "${BOLD}║${RESET} ${CYAN}Custom Metric:${RESET} %-34s ${BOLD}║${RESET}\n" "Your value here"
```

### Day Counter

To reset or adjust your day counter:

```zsh
# Reset to day 1
echo "1" > ~/.cc-current-day

# Jump to a specific day
echo "42" > ~/.cc-current-day
```

## Platform Compatibility

The scripts have been improved to work across different platforms:

### macOS

All scripts work natively on macOS with no additional configuration.

### Linux

The scripts use platform detection to use the appropriate date commands on Linux:

```zsh
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]]; then
  # macOS date commands
  COMPLETION_DATE=$(date -v+${DAYS_REMAINING}d +"%Y-%m-%d")
else
  # Linux date commands
  COMPLETION_DATE=$(date -d "+${DAYS_REMAINING} days" +"%Y-%m-%d")
fi
```

### Windows (WSL)

The scripts work in Windows Subsystem for Linux with no modifications needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Script Not Found

```zsh
# Check if scripts are in ~/bin
ls -la ~/bin

# Check if ~/bin is in your PATH
echo $PATH | grep "$HOME/bin"

# Add to PATH if needed
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Permission Denied

```zsh
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x ~/bin/cc-*.sh
```

### Day Counter Issues

```zsh
# Check day counter value
cat ~/.cc-current-day

# Reset if corrupted
echo "1" > ~/.cc-current-day
```

### tmux Errors

```zsh
# Check if tmux is installed
which tmux

# Install if needed
# macOS: brew install tmux
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install tmux
# Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install tmux

# Kill stuck sessions
tmux kill-session -t coding-challenge
```

### Directory Structure Issues

```zsh
# Verify directory structure
ls -la ~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge

# Create if missing
mkdir -p ~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge/{logs,phase1_ruby,phase2_python,phase3_javascript,phase4_fullstack,phase5_ml_finance}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Adding Custom Scripts

You can create additional scripts to enhance your workflow:

```zsh
# Example: Weekly summary generator
cat > ~/bin/cc-weekly-summary.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/zsh

# Get current week
CURRENT_DAY=$(cat ~/.cc-current-day 2>/dev/null || echo 1)
WEEK_OVERALL=$(( ($CURRENT_DAY-1) / 6 + 1 ))

# Generate summary
echo "Generating summary for Week $WEEK_OVERALL..."
# Add your summary generation code here

EOF

chmod +x ~/bin/cc-weekly-summary.sh
```

### Debugging Scripts

To troubleshoot issues, run scripts in debug mode:

```zsh
zsh -x ~/bin/cc-start-day.sh
```

This will show each command as it executes, helping identify issues.

### Backup and Restore

To backup your challenge progress:

```zsh
# Backup day counter
cp ~/.cc-current-day ~/cc-day-backup

# Backup entire repository
cd ~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge
git bundle create ~/challenge-backup.bundle --all
```

To restore:

```zsh
# Restore day counter
cp ~/cc-day-backup ~/.cc-current-day

# Restore repository
git clone ~/challenge-backup.bundle ~/projects/6-7-coding-challenge-restored
```

# About the 6/7 Coding Challenge

## What Is It?

The 6/7 Coding Challenge is a personal commitment to code for 500 days, six days a week (Monday through Saturday), while observing the Sabbath rest on Sundays. It's designed to build programming mastery through consistent practice while maintaining a sustainable pace that respects religious observance.

## Why This Challenge?

The traditional "100 days of code" or similar challenges often encourage daily coding without breaks. This modified challenge acknowledges the importance of regular rest while still maintaining the discipline and consistency that builds skills.

### Benefits:

1. **Skill Development**: Consistent practice of programming fundamentals
2. **Portfolio Building**: Creation of numerous projects across different domains
3. **Career Advancement**: Demonstrated commitment to software engineering excellence
4. **Structured Learning**: Alignment with Launch School's mastery-based approach
5. **Sustainable Pace**: Prevention of burnout through regular rest
6. **Value Alignment**: Honoring religious observance while pursuing professional growth

## Challenge Philosophy

This challenge follows several key principles:

1. **Mastery over Surface Knowledge**: Focus on deep understanding rather than superficial exposure
2. **Consistency over Intensity**: Regular, moderate practice is more effective than sporadic intense sessions
3. **Application over Theory**: Hands-on projects that apply concepts learned through Launch School
4. **Documentation over Silent Progress**: Regular reflection and public sharing of the journey
5. **Structure over Randomness**: Organized phases targeting specific skill areas
6. **Rest as Essential**: Recognition that regular rest enhances productivity and creativity

## Five Phase Structure

The challenge is divided into five 100-day phases:

### Phase 1: Ruby Backend (Days 1-100)
Building a strong foundation in server-side programming with Ruby, focusing on fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and basic web servers with Sinatra.

### Phase 2: Python Data Analysis (Days 101-200)
Developing data analysis skills with Python, focusing on libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, with an introduction to machine learning concepts.

### Phase 3: JavaScript Frontend (Days 201-300)
Building client-side programming skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, including modern frameworks and interactive visualization.

### Phase 4: Full-Stack Projects (Days 301-400)
Integrating backend and frontend skills to create complete web applications, focusing on CRUD operations, authentication, and deployment.

### Phase 5: ML Finance Applications (Days 401-500)
Specializing in machine learning applications for finance, preparing for future career goals in the ML finance sector.

## Launch School Integration

This challenge is designed to complement the Launch School curriculum:

- Challenge projects apply concepts learned in Launch School courses
- Weekly planning aligns challenge work with current Launch School material
- Project structure matches Launch School's emphasis on mastery
- Challenge phases build toward career goals beyond Launch School

## Measuring Success

Success in this challenge is measured by:

1. **Consistency**: Completing the required days of coding
2. **Portfolio Growth**: Number and quality of projects created
3. **Skill Development**: Mastery of targeted technologies
4. **Documentation**: Quality of reflections and logs
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Application of Launch School concepts
6. **Career Advancement**: Progress toward software engineering and ML finance goals

## Documentation

# Dev.to Article Outline: The 6/7 Coding Challenge

## Title
**The 6/7 Coding Challenge: How I'm Coding for 500 Days While Respecting the Sabbath**

## Introduction
- Brief personal introduction (software engineering student at Launch School)
- The challenge concept: 500 days of coding, 6 days per week
- The core philosophy: mastery through consistent practice with intentional rest
- Code snippet showing a sample of the automation script
```zsh
# Preview of the status script that tracks progress
ccstatus
```

## Why Another Coding Challenge?
- Pain points with traditional challenges (burnout, quality vs. quantity)
- The missing element: structured rest and recovery
- Quote from John C. Maxwell: "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail."
- How this challenge combines discipline with sustainability

## The 5 Phases of the Challenge
- Overview of the phase structure with skill progression
- Code block showing directory structure
```zsh
# Directory structure for the challenge
├── phase1_ruby/
│   ├── week01/
│   │   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── day02/
│   └── ...
├── phase2_python/
# etc.
```
- Brief explanation of each phase's focus
- How this aligns with a real-world engineering career path

## The Technical Setup
- GitHub repository organization
- Automation scripts breakdown with code examples
```zsh
# Example of the day starter script
ccstart
```
- Progress tracking and documentation approach
- Public accountability through GitHub history

## Launch School + 6/7 Challenge
- How the challenge complements Launch School's curriculum
- Code example showing a day's Launch School integration
```markdown
# Day 42 - Phase 1 (Week 07)

## Launch School Connection
- Current course: RB120 - OOP
- Concept application: Implementing a custom enumerable in Ruby
```
- Strategies for reinforcing course material
- Building out portfolio projects alongside formal learning

## The Power of the Sabbath Rest
- Brief explanation of the Sabbath concept (religious or philosophical)
- Why one day of complete rest improves the other six days
- How this creates a sustainable pace for long-term growth
- Addressing the "coding streak" pressure in developer culture

## My Automation Toolkit
- Detailed breakdown of the shell scripts
- Code examples of the most useful automation functions
```zsh
# Push updates and increment the day counter
ccpush
```
- Terminal-centric workflow with tmux and neovim
- How automation reduces friction in daily practice

## How You Can Adapt This Challenge
- Options for different time commitments
- Alternative phase structures for different specializations
- Customizing for different religious practices or rest patterns
- Code snippet showing how to modify the phase structure
```zsh
# Modifying phase structure in the setup script
case $PHASE in
  1) PHASE_DIR="phase1_frontend" ;;
  2) PHASE_DIR="phase2_backend" ;;
  # etc.
esac
```

## Getting Started
- Step-by-step guide for setting up your own challenge

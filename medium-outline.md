## Title
**The 6/7 Coding Challenge: 500 Days of Deliberate Practice While Honoring the Sabbath**

## Subtitle
A sustainable approach to mastery-based learning for software engineers

## Introduction
- Open with a personal anecdote about your journey into software engineering
- Introduce the challenge concept (500 days of coding, 6 days per week)
- Establish the tension between constant practice and the need for rest
- End with a thesis statement about sustainable mastery

## The Problem with Traditional Coding Challenges
- Overview of popular challenges (100 days of code, etc.)
- Critique of consecutive day challenges (burnout, quality issues)
- Research insights on the importance of rest in skill acquisition
- The religious and philosophical dimensions of the Sabbath concept

## The 6/7 Challenge Framework
- Detailed explanation of the challenge structure
- The significance of 500 days (approximately 20 months)
- The 5-phase progression and why it's structured this way
- How each phase builds on the previous one

## Phase 1-5 Breakdown
- Deep dive into each phase's focus and expected outcomes
- Sample projects appropriate for each phase
- Skills acquired during each phase
- How each phase connects to real-world engineering roles

## Integration with Launch School
- Brief explanation of Launch School's mastery-based approach
- How the challenge complements formal education
- Strategies for aligning coursework with challenge projects
- Using the challenge to reinforce and extend curriculum concepts

## The Technical Infrastructure
- Repository structure and organization
- Automation scripts for maintaining momentum
- Documentation practices for tracking progress
- Public accountability through GitHub and social media

## Beyond Code: The Career Strategy
- How the challenge builds a compelling portfolio
- Positioning yourself for higher-tier software roles
- Creating evidence of both breadth and specialization
- The connection to ML finance and specialized career paths

## The Power of Rest
- Deeper exploration of the Sabbath concept in a secular context
- Scientific research on recovery and creative thinking
- How rest enhances rather than detracts from productivity
- The wisdom of ancient practices in modern skill development

## Adapting the Challenge
- How others might modify the framework for their needs
- Alternative phase structures for different career paths
- Flexible implementation for different religious practices or rest patterns
- Scaling up or down based on time constraints

## Measuring Success
- Defining clear metrics for challenge progress
- Qualitative assessment of skill development
- Portfolio growth as a tangible outcome
- The long-term impact on engineering identity

## Getting Started
- Step-by-step guide to setting up your own challenge
- Resources and tools to support your journey
- Building a community of like-minded learners
- Overcoming common obstacles and resistance

## Conclusion
- Personal commitment statement
- Invitation for others to join or create their own version
- Vision for where you'll be at the end of 500 days
- Final thought connecting to your opening quote

## Call to Action

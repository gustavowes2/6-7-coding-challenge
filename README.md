# 6/7 Coding Challenge

> "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail." - John C. Maxwell

A 500-day coding challenge (6 days per week) aligned with Launch School's mastery-based learning approach.

## Challenge Overview

The 6/7 Coding Challenge is my commitment to code for 500 days (Monday through Saturday) while observing the Sabbath rest on Sundays. This structured approach allows for consistent skill development while honoring religious observance and preventing burnout.

## Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into 5 phases of 100 days each:

1. **Foundation Phase (Days 1-100)**: Ruby backend development
2. **Data Phase (Days 101-200)**: Python data analysis/ML foundations
3. **Interface Phase (Days 201-300)**: JavaScript frontend
4. **Integration Phase (Days 301-400)**: Full-stack projects
5. **Specialization Phase (Days 401-500)**: ML finance applications

Each week consists of 6 coding days (Monday-Saturday) with Sunday reserved for rest.

## Current Status

- **Current Day**: [Day Number]/500
- **Current Phase**: [Phase Number]/5
- **Current Week**: [Week Number]
- **Progress**: [Percentage]% complete

## Phase 1 Progress: Ruby Backend

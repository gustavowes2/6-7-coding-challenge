# Embarking on My 6/7 Coding Challenge Journey ðŸš€

Today I'm committing to a significant professional development initiative: the 6/7 Coding Challengeâ€”500 days of coding (6 days per week) while honoring the Sabbath rest on Sundays.

## Why This Challenge?

As a software engineering student at Launch School, I've embraced their mastery-based learning philosophy. This challenge extends that approach with consistent, deliberate practice structured over approximately 84 weeks (20 months).

## The 5-Phase Journey

My challenge is structured in phases aligned with my career goals:

1. **Ruby Backend** (Days 1-100): Building server-side fundamentals
2. **Python Data Analysis** (Days 101-200): Developing data skills with Python
3. **JavaScript Frontend** (Days 201-300): Crafting interactive user experiences
4. **Full-Stack Integration** (Days 301-400): Connecting all the pieces
5. **ML Finance Applications** (Days 401-500): Specializing in my target career field

## Career Integration

This structured approach supports my career trajectory from Launch School toward ML finance roles. By the completion of this challenge, I'll have:

- A substantial GitHub portfolio demonstrating applied skills
- 500 days of documented coding practice
- A skill set encompassing full-stack development and ML specialization
- A strong foundation for Georgia Tech's OMSCS program

## Follow My Journey

I'll be documenting every step on GitHub and sharing key insights here on LinkedIn. I welcome connections with others on similar paths or those interested in mastery-based learning approaches.

As John C. Maxwell says, "Master the basics. Then practice them every day without fail."

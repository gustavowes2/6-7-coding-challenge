Today I'm embarking on an ambitious journey: the 6/7 Coding Challenge—500 days of coding while honoring the Sabbath.

I'm committing to code 6 days a week (Monday-Saturday) for 500 total coding days, creating a structured path toward software engineering mastery. This challenge combines consistent skill-building with deliberate rest—coding with purpose while respecting the Sabbath.

True mastery requires both consistent practice AND strategic rest. By honoring the Sabbath (Sundays), I'm building sustainability into this long-term commitment while aligning with my values.

My challenge is structured in 5 phases of 100 days each:

1. **Ruby Backend** (Days 1-100): Building server-side fundamentals
2. **Python Data Analysis** (Days 101-200): Developing data skills with Python
3. **JavaScript Frontend** (Days 201-300): Crafting interactive user experiences
4. **Full-Stack Integration** (Days 301-400): Connecting all the pieces
5. **ML Finance Applications** (Days 401-500): Specializing in my target career field

This challenge directly supports my trajectory from Launch School to ML finance roles by:

- Building a substantial portfolio demonstrating my skills
- Creating public evidence of my consistent dedication
- Developing specialized knowledge in high-demand areas
- Establishing the disciplined habits needed for long-term success
